## üëã Introduction

**Sia** is an **open-source personal assistant** who can live **on your server or local system**.

She **does stuff** when you **ask her for**.

You can **talk to her** and she can **talk to you**.
You can also **text her** and she can also **text you**.
If you want to, Sia can communicate with you by being **offline to protect your privacy**.

### Why?

> 1. If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life.
> Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, Leon can help you with his
> packages/modules (skills) structure.
> 2. With this generic structure, everyone can create their own modules and share them with others.
> Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).
> 3. Leon uses AI concepts, which is cool.
> 4. Privacy matters, you can configure Leon to talk with him offline. You can already text with him without any third party services.
> 5. Open source is great.

### What is this repository for?

> This repository contains the following nodes of Leon:
> - The server
> - The packages/modules
> - The web app
> - The hotword node

### What is Sia able to do?

> Today, the most interesting part is about her core and the way she can scale up. She is pretty young but can easily scale to have new features (packages/modules).

Sounds cool right? Then let's get started!
